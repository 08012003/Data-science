        "## What is MongoDB?\n",
        "\n",
        "**MongoDB** is a popular, open-source, **NoSQL** database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called **BSON** (Binary JSON). It is designed for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data and is known for its scalability, flexibility, and performance. MongoDB is a document-oriented database, meaning that data is stored as documents (collections of key-value pairs) rather than in tables like in traditional SQL databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Non-Relational Databases\n",
        "\n",
        "**Non-relational databases**, also known as **NoSQL** databases, store data in formats other than tables (e.g., key-value pairs, graphs, or documents). These databases are used for handling unstructured or semi-structured data and are highly flexible in terms of schema. They are scalable, especially in distributed environments, and provide high performance for specific use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "## When to Use MongoDB Over SQL Databases\n",
        "\n",
        "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in the following scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Flexible Schema**: When data structure changes frequently or is semi-structured (e.g., JSON-like data).\n",
        "2. **Scalability**: When the application needs to handle large volumes of data and require horizontal scaling (sharding).\n",
        "3. **Unstructured Data**: When the data does not fit well into a traditional table structure (e.g., social media data, logs, or IoT data).\n",
        "4. **High Throughput and Low Latency**: When applications require high write throughput and low latency, such as in real-time analytics.\n",
        "5. **Development Speed**: When rapid development is needed, MongoDB allows developers to iterate quickly with less concern about schema design.\n"

        "5. **Replication**: Provides high availability through replica sets, ensuring data is automatically replicated across multiple servers for fault tolerance.\n"
